# Rossmann challenge using Keras

This is a simple implementation of the 3rd place  result in the Rossman Kaggle competition loosely based on Guo/Berkhahn's Entity Embeddings of Categorical Variables using Keras and scikit-learn. 

Moreover, the feature engineering and data cleaning is ommited, but it uses the outputs from the fastai course and the rossman challenge lecture(https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/courses/dl1/lesson3-rossman.ipynb)
